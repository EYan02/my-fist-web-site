        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the <strong>core technologies of the World Wide Web,</strong> alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:20px">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
